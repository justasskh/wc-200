# WooCommerce Gifting Flow Implementation Instructions

## CRITICAL FIX: Modal Display Issues

We've identified and fixed several critical issues with the modal display according to the Lithuanian language requirements:

1. **Solid White Background**: The modal now has a solid white background as required.

2. **Two-Column Header Layout**: 
   - Left column: "Tęsti apsipirkimą" link (return link) aligned to the left
   - Right column: "Saugus atsiskaitymas" text aligned to the right

3. **Content Width and Centering**:
   - Set maximum width to 1344px
   - Content is properly centered within this container
   - Fixed the issue where add-ons and bottom bar content extended to the edge

4. **Two-Column Bottom Bar**:
   - Left column:
     - Main line: "Užsakymo suma: [price] €" with dynamically calculated price
     - Sub-line: "Įskaičiuotas [ship] € pristatymo mokestis" with shipping price
     - Alternative sub-line for free shipping: "Įskaičiuotas nemokamas pristatymas"
   - Right column:
     - Button with text "Pereiti prie pristatymo informacijos"
     - This button navigates to step 2

5. **Dynamic Price Calculation**:
   - Base price: Product price where the popup was initiated
   - Added shipping price: Default WooCommerce preselected shipping method
   - Price updates when add-ons or greeting cards with prices are selected
   - Price format shows amount followed by Euro symbol (€)

Follow these steps to implement the enhanced add-ons and greeting cards functionality in your WordPress environment:

## 1. Upload the Modified Files

Upload the following files to your WordPress site, replacing the existing files:

- `assets/wcflow.js` - Main JavaScript file with enhanced add-ons and greeting cards functionality
- `assets/wcflow-styles.css` - CSS styles for the enhanced interface
- `assets/greeting-cards-slider.js` - JavaScript for the greeting cards slider with deselection functionality
- `assets/greeting-cards-slider.css` - CSS styles for the greeting cards slider
- `modal-fix.js` - **CRITICAL FIX** for the modal display issue (place this in the root plugin directory)

## 2. Update Plugin Configuration

1. Make sure the main plugin file (`woocommerce-gifting-flow.php`) is properly enqueuing the CSS and JS files:
   - It should load `wcflow-styles.css` instead of `wcflow.css`
   - It should also load `greeting-cards-slider.js` and `greeting-cards-slider.css`

## 3. IMPORTANT: Force a Cache Refresh (Critical for Modal Fix)

To ensure your changes take effect immediately:

1. Upload the `refresh-plugin.php` file to your WordPress site
2. Visit this file in your browser (e.g., https://yoursite.com/wp-content/plugins/woocommerce-gifting-flow/refresh-plugin.php)
3. This will clear all caches and force a refresh of the plugin's assets

## 4. Alternative Cache Clearing Methods

If the refresh script doesn't work, try these alternative methods:

1. In WordPress admin, go to Settings > WooCommerce Gifting Flow and save settings (even without changes)
2. Install a cache clearing plugin like "WP Fastest Cache" or "W3 Total Cache" and clear all caches
3. Add a version parameter to your CSS and JS files in the browser URL to bypass cache (e.g., ?ver=1.0.1)
4. Clear your browser cache or use incognito mode to test

## 5. Verify Implementation

After implementing the changes, verify that:

1. The "Send as gift" button opens the modal properly
2. Add-ons have "More information" buttons that show popups with full descriptions
3. Add-ons have blue "Add" buttons that change to red "Remove" buttons when selected
4. Unselected add-ons are dimmed (opacity: 0.5) when at least one add-on is selected
5. Greeting cards can be deselected by clicking them again
6. The message field is disabled when no card is selected

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify that all files were uploaded correctly
3. Make sure the plugin is properly enqueuing all required CSS and JS files
4. Try deactivating and reactivating the plugin
5. Try using the standalone test files (examples/standalone-test.html) to verify functionality
